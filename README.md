### Game Description:

#### This game is a target shooting game that allows users to shoot a ball at the target board, and there are points on the board based on the different areas of the board. Players can get scores when they shoot the ball to the target board.

#### Why it is a Game:
1. Players have a clear goal to win the game and score as high as they want by shooting the ball to the target board.
2. There are rules in the game, such as you are only allowed to shoot one ball at once, and points are attached to the different areas of the board.
3. This game is interactive, players can choose where they want to shoot the ball
4. It also can give emotional feedback through the scoring function, where players will see their score during the game.

### Inspiration:
My inspiration for this simple game came from the tutorial that the professor gave in this assignment, at the beginning it was a a target board with no rules for shooting the ball, then I wanted to create something that had more interactions to it, so I made this shooting game.
